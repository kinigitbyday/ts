 * logic with this function will cause all timers to automatically and immediately resolve.
 *
 * @note See App P2P.test.ts for example usages (the p2p control functions internally use waitForTransactionToSettle which has built in waits and retries)
 * @note This must be used in tandem with jest.useFakeTimers()
