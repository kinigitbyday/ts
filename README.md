[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@paradoxical-io%2Ftypes.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@paradoxical-io%2Ftypes) ![build status](https://github.com/paradoxical-io/ts/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

A collection of useful typescript first common libraries, tooling, and shared utilities.

The main goal is to create simple and safe production level code that is easy to test, has distributed tracing built in, branded types first, and dependency injected for easy extension.
